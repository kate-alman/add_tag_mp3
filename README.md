It's just a little script that made my life easier.

Adds title and artist tags for songs if they are unknown.

main_path is the path to the folder containing the folders or the music folder e.g. /media/User/General/Music it contains other music folders such as Ambient, Pop, etc.
If you have music in one folder, specify the path to its parent folder, you can temporarily put the music folder in another.
